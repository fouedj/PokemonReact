# Getting Started with Create React App

## Welcome to the Pok√©Tech Challenge!

## üåü Hey, future code master! üåü

Prepare to dive into the exciting and somewhat crazy world of Pok√©Tech. Our team of young technophiles has put together a technical test for you that is as fun as it is enriching. Your mission, if you accept it: to bring a somewhat capricious Pok√©mon application back to life and give it your personal touch!

## üöÄ The Challenge

## Step 1: Revive Pok√©mon

We have an existing project - a Pok√©mon app - which unfortunately has compilation issues. Your first quest will be to play detective, identify bugs and fix them. Be careful, some can be sneakier than others!

## Step 2: Creative Evolution

Once you've brought our app back to life, it's time to move up a gear. Adds a new feature! Something unique, that lets your skills and creativity shine. Let your imagination run wild, but remember to follow the project's best practices and code conventions.

## üìã Instructions

Languages Used: JavaScript, with a pinch of HTML and CSS.
Pok√©mon API: You are free to use PokeAPI to bring your application to life.
Best Practices: Clean, well-documented code is like a Max Potion for your application!
Testing: Make sure your addition works perfectly.
Documentation: A clear and detailed README for your new feature would be great.

## üéâ Why Participate?

This test is your chance to shine and show that you are the champion we are looking for. It's also an opportunity to learn, have fun and work on something a little different.

## üìö Useful Resources

Beginner's Guide to React (just in case)
PokeAPI Documentation

## ü§ù Contribution

Fork the Repo: Start by forking the project.
Clone on your Local: Work locally for more comfort.
Branches: Create a branch for your feature.
Pull Request: Once you're ready, send us your PR!

## üìû Need Help?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
