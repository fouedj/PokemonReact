## Welcome to the PokÃ©Tech Challenge!

## ðŸŒŸ Hey, future code master! ðŸŒŸ

Prepare to dive into the exciting and somewhat crazy world of PokÃ©Tech. Our team of young technophiles has put together a technical test for you that is as fun as it is enriching. Your mission, if you accept it: to bring a somewhat capricious PokÃ©mon application back to life and give it your personal touch!

## ðŸš€ The Challenge

Hello,
In order to pass this test you have to:

1-Use "react-router" and "react-router-dom" to create a page home for the list of pokemons an a page detail for the pokemon details

2-Use "react-redux" to handle the global state of the app (using redux toolkit is a +)

3-Use the pokemon api
https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2
to dynimize the list of pokemons page and the pokemon details page using api calls

4-Make the necessary css changes for the app to best fit for the user experience

5-Factorize the redendent code

6-Make a pagination for the list of pokemon

7-Using Typescript is a +

/!\ note that you have 2 screenshots in the src/publi folder named pokemon 1 and pokemon 2 showing what your app will look like at the end of your work

Good luck!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
